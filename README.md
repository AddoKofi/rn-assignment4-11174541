## Introduction

This project is a simple React application that uses React Router v6 for client-side routing. The app includes a basic authentication flow with `Login` and `HomePage` components. Navigation is managed using `BrowserRouter` from `react-router-dom`, and routing paths are defined to guide users through the application.
